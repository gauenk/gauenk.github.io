abstract={This paper presents an efficient method to compute space-time superpixels and an application of the superpixels called superpixel convolution. The space-time superpixel method extends a single-image Bayesian method named BASS. Our approach, named Bayesian-inspired Space-Time Superpixels (BIST), is inspired by hill-climbing to a local mode of a Dirichlet-Process Gaussian Mixture Model conditioned on the previous frameâ€™s superpixel information. The method is only Bayesian-inspired, rather than actually Bayesian, because the split/merge steps are treated as a classification problem rather than derived from a Gibbs sampling update step. However, this heuristic reduces the number of split/merge steps from several hundred per frame to only a few. BIST is over twice as fast as BASS and over 10 times faster than other space-time superpixel methods with favorable (and sometimes superior) quality. Additionally, to garner interest in superpixels, this paper demonstrates their use within deep neural networks. We present a superpixel-weighted convolution layer for single-image denoising that outperforms standard convolution by 1.89 dB PSNR.},

  abstract={Images contain objects with deformable boundaries, such as the contours of a human face, yet attention operators act on square windows. This mixes features from perceptually unrelated regions, which can degrade the quality of a denoiser. This paper proposes using superpixel probabilities to re-weight the local attention map. If images are modeled with latent superpixel probabilities, we show our re-weighted attention module matches the theoretically optimal denoiser. The left image shows that NA mixes information from the unrelated blue region, Hard-SNA improperly rejects pixels from the adjacent orange regions, and SNA correctly selects the all the orange pixels and rejects the blue pixels.},

  abstract={Computing attention maps for videos is challenging due to the motion of objects between frames. Small spatial inaccuracies significantly impact the attention module's quality. Recent works propose using a deep network to correct these small inaccuracies. In this project, we efficiently implement a space-time grid search which outperforms existing deep neural network alternatives. The image on the left shows a no-shift search, a search using a deep network from related works, and our proposed shifted non-local search.}
