Hello :wave: I use self-similarity and superpixels as an inductive bias to improve modules for deep neural networks. The applications of my research have focused on image/video denoising, but can apply more broadly across pixel-level computer vision tasks (deblurring, segmentation, etc). I am currently working to conenct my research on 2D+time videos to the real-world's 3D-space.
